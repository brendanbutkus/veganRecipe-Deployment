# Vegan-Recipes-Project

Vegan recipe website that lets users post vegan recipes which can include:
1. image url
2. recipe
3. ingredients
4. macro nutrient breakdown - protein, fat, carbs

The website gives athletes and non atlhetes the chance to share nutrition conscious recipes, that support high activity lifestyle and/or the desire to improve health.  These types of recipes will be in more demand as people switch to plant based diets or decide to add plant based meals to their lifestyle.

Building this website was a good experience for: working on a team, becoming more familiar with GitHub, using Amazon Web Services for deployment, and coding practice with MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node)

Future plans for website are to create a way for users to determine ingredient measurements for desired amount of prepared servings.
